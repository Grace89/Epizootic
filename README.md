## Abstract: 
Generalist emerging infectious diseases threaten biodiversity, food security, and human health. Despite their ubiquity, little is known about how generalist pathogens spread within and between taxa. Here, we examine temporal synchrony in disease prevalence, infection intensity and host mortality among seven amphibian families during the 2004 chytridiomycosis epizootic at El Cop√©, Panama caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). We detected temporal synchrony of Bd prevalence among amphibian families, temporal asynchrony of infection intensity, and no signature of either temporal synchrony or asynchrony for host mortality. To investigate mechanisms causing temporal synchrony (superspreaders, environmental reservoirs, number of contacts among taxa), we used simulations and a multi-host SIR model. We found that the presence of an abiotic reservoir influenced temporal synchrony more than either superspreaders or the number of contacts among taxa. This study provides a rare glimpse of the patterns and mechanisms driving transmission of a generalist emerging infectious disease, known to cause mass mortality across ecologically and evolutionarily diverse species assemblages.
